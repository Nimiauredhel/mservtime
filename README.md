A simple Linux kernel module logging packets captured by a netfilter 'ingress' hook and responding with an RTC timestamp.
A /dev character device facilitates starting/stopping capture as well as selecting a network interface to observe.
The 'user' folder contains a few bash scripts to streamline operating the module and reading its output.
